# My Portfolio Project

The intention of this project is to give an overview of what I've acomplished over the past several years of teaching myself to code.
It doubles as a way for me to try and keep track of all the side projects I keep starting.
Be aware that there may be many unfinished and/or unpolished bits of code lying within the projects linked to

**Note:** *(three-view)* When cloning this directory to work on the project locally, run `npm run setup` before building anything with webpack
