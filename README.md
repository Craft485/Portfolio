# My Portfolio Project

The intention of this project is to give an overview of what I've acomplished over the past several years of teaching myself to code.
It doubles as a way for me to try and keep track of all the side projects I keep starting.
Be aware that there may be many unfinished and/or unpolished bits of code lying within the projects linked to

#### Notes:

The `dist` directory is ignored for this repo, it contains the final bundled JS that is being hosted online.
The only file in there that may be of the slightest interest to anyone is the index.html found there, but view source exists.
